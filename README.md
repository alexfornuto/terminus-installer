# Terminus Installer
This is an **unoficial third party** script to help new users install [Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus) to a standard location, and add that location to `$PATH` so it can be called from any directory.

## Usage
This script is written in PHP. Using it is as easy as downloading it and passing it to `php`. The following one-liner will do both:

```bash
curl -O https://github.com/pantheon-systems/alexfornuto/blob/master/installer.php && php installer.php
```
